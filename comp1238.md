## Week 1 - History of Writing
- Writing evolved from cave paintings to cuneiform clay tablets.
- Alphabets like Phoenician led to modern languages and type systems.

## Week 2 - Representing Text and Numbers
- ASCII maps numbers to characters (e.g., 65 = “A”).
- Bytes are 8 bits, forming the basic unit of storage.
- Memory can be volatile (RAM) or non-volatile (SSD/HDD).

## Week 3 - Structure of Text
- Markdown and HTML organize and format digital text.
- JSON and XML are structured data formats used in software.
- Escaping special characters prevents formatting errors.


## Week 4 - Text Editors and Tools
- Text editors (VS Code, Vim) are used for coding; word processors are not.
- Regex allows advanced search and pattern matching.
- Efficient typing and shortcuts improve workflow.
- GitHub Pages converts Markdown into live web pages.

## Week 5 - Command Line Interfaces
- CLI lets users control computers with typed commands.
- Common commands: `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `grep`, and `ping`.
- CLIs are lightweight, fast, and ideal for automation.
